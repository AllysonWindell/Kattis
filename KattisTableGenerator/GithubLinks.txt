# Github Links go here and must direct to the folder that contains your code.
# The # or // at the very beginning of a line can be used to indicate a comment
# and the program also ignores blank lines.

# Other information:
# After executing the program, it creates a LatestLog.txt that will output
# what was happening during the its running process.
# Additionally, it will output a README.md file that contains the table
# and you can edit it if you so desire.
# Source code will be on Github in the future, user MiniDomo.
# You can delete these comments if you want.
# One last thing, when the program is done running, it will focus on itself.
