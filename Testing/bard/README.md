gen.java is supposed to generate possible test cases.  
Once you run gen.java then should copy and paste the output to a txt file called "test.txt" to test bardTest.java and make sure the file location is correct.  
Or you could just copy the output from gen.java and paste it into a regular scanner to test it out.
